In assembly source, the NASM assembler expects operands to be specified as destination, source (Intel syntax) while the gas assembler expects operands to be specified as source, destination (AT&T syntax). The assembler language for the various CPUs (e.g. MC68000, AMD64, ARM, etc.) each specify whether the left operand is source or destination.
